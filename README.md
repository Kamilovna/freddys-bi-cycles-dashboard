# Power BI Study Project — Freddys BI‑Cycles Dashboard

This repository contains a study project created as part of my Power BI coursework.
The goal of the project was to practice data modeling, visualization, and storytelling using the AdventureWorks dataset.

This report consists of three main analysis pages:
- Försäljningsanalys
- HR-analys
- Lager-analys

Each page focuses on a different business area and provides interactive insights for decision‑making.
